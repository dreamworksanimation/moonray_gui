# moonray_gui
This repository contains the moonray_gui command-line QT application.  It can be used to view render progress and final results.
It has been separated from moonray so that moonray does not need a Qt requirement.

This repository is part of the larger MoonRay/Arras codebase.  It is included as a submodule in the top-level
OpenMoonRay repository located here: [OpenMoonRay](https://github.com/dreamworksanimation/openmoonray)
